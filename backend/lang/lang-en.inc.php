$l['WhatIsDenkDevHeading'] = 'What is Denk Development?';
$l['WhatIsDenkDevParagraph'] = 'Denk Development is a Zurich-based <strong>hardware and software development company</strong>, operated by me, <a href="http://www.timodenk.com">Timo</a>. I founded the company during the time I graduated from high school (in June 2016) because I started to receive requests for support with projects frequently. For five years I ran DenkDev as a secondary employment and have completed over 50 projects successfully.<br><br>In mid 2021 I started working for Google and decided to turn the company into a pro bono effort with which I <b>support projects entirely free of charge</b>. People seeking for support are invited to apply with their projects on this website and I choose depending on how interesting/challenging and meaninful the projects seem to me personally.<br><br>My motivation for running DenkDev in the pro bono mode is the following: I to get to work on projects ouside of the scope of my normal day-to-day work. That involves getting to know people who come from vastly different backgrounds. <strong>Pulling the monetary aspect entirely out of the customer relationship makes it more enjoyable</strong>.';
